### WIP
Desktoop [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) clone.  
300$, and I'll change the name.

### Goals:
- [X] Hot reloading and syntax error reporting (to stdout).
- [X] Global bindings (will add useful bindings as needed).
  - `TIME` in seconds (f32) from the start of the renderer.
- [ ] Record and save shader output as an image/gif/mp4.
  - Pressing F5 will 'screenshot' the current frame and save it as .png file.
- [ ] GLSL support.
- [ ] Little preprocessor.
- [ ] Load multiple shader files.
- [ ] Load images and/or videos.
- [ ] Interactive GUI (error reporting, 'record' commands like in glslViwer etc) instead of CLI.
