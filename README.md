### WIP
Desktoop [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) clone.  
300$, and I'll change the name.

### Goals:
- [X] Hot reloading and syntax error reporting.
- [ ] Global constants: time, mouse position etc.
- [ ] Load multiple shader files.
- [ ] Load images and/or videos.
- [ ] GLSL shaders rendering (maybe auto-detect filetype or allow to specify by CLI option).
- [ ] Record and save shader output as an image/gif/mp4.
- [ ] (Maybe) Refactor as a library and allow people to play with [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) settings.
